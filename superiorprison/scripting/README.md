# Scripting
With SuperiorPrison, comes a system of scripting! Scripting allows **you** to customize features such as **ranks** and **prestiges**, and more coming soon!

### What is scripting? Where can we use scripting?
Scripting provides a way for you to customize the plugin. For example, you're able to unlimited prestiges. Throughout this scripting documentation, we'll be talking about the scripting language for SuperiorPrison.

Features:
* Conditions
* Use Math
* Set values and Get Values
* And much more as well as much more to come...

As of now, we can use scripting in **RANKS** and **PRESTIGES**! In the future, you'll be able to script with the enchantment system as well.
