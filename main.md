# BG-Software's Wiki

Welcome to the wiki page of BG-Software!<br>
Here you can find useful information regarding all of our products, tutorials and more!<br>
If you need help with something regarding our products, want to file a bug report or just want to say hello, make sure you join our [discord server](https://bg-software.com/discord/)!<br><br>


## Contributing
Our wiki is hosted on Github Pages, and all of the pages are based on markdown.<br>
You can help us with expending it by visiting the [github repository](https://github.com/OmerBenGera/BGSoftware-Wiki), fork it and do your changes.<br>
After you're done, make a pull-request that will be reviewed by the staff team.<br><br>
<u>Please note</u>: Every PR should make changes for one page only. If you change multiple pages, make separate PRs.<br>
If you believe your changes should be in one PR, keep it like this - but be aware that it can be denied.<br><br>
You are more than welcome to give yourself a credit at the bottom of the page - if that's a useful tutorial, you deserve it!<br>
If you make changes to a page with an existing credit, just add your name alongside of the current credit - do not remove credits of others.
